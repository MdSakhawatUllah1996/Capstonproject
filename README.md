Deep Learning-Based Cotton Leaf Disease Detection Using  DenseNet V3 
The dataset gathered from Kaggle is used in this study to test and assess the Cotton Leaf Disease  classification algorithm. To precisely train and test the system, I used InceptionV3,  mobileNetV2, and DenseNet techniques. I note that the categorization of Cotton Leaf Disease  performs better using the DenseNet technique.
